Migrate custom fields from Advanced Custom Fields to Meta Box.

== Description ==

This tool helps you migrate custom fields from Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) to Meta Box.

**Meta Box is a powerful, professional, and lightweight toolkit for developers to create custom meta boxes and custom fields for any custom post type in WordPress.**

Switching from ACF to Meta Box gives you lots of benefits:

- A wide-range of field types and options. Meta Box supports [40+ built-in WordPress custom field types](https://docs.metabox.io/field-settings/) for all your needs. You can also [effortlessly create your own field type](https://docs.metabox.io/custom-field-type/).
- Meta Box supports cloning fields for most field types including the WYSIWYG editor field. It also supports [repeatable field groups](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-group/).
- Meta Box has an ultra-lightweight, yet powerful API that won't overload your site.
- Meta Box uses the [native WordPress meta data storage](https://docs.metabox.io/database/) and functions for ease of use and lightning-fast processing.
- Meta Box has a ton of [free and premium extensions](https://metabox.io/plugins/) available to further extend the already powerful core Meta Box plugin so you can supercharge your custom fields in WordPress.

See more details at the [comparison page between ACF and Meta Box](https://metabox.io/meta-box-vs-acf/).
